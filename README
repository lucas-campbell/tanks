TestClient.py: This is used to test the functionality of our Client code. We use this to see if the Client is able
sucessfuly send to and recieve messages from the server

TankServer.py:This is used to test the functionality of our Server code. We use this to see if the Server is able 
to sucessfully send to and recieve messages from the Client 

Display.py: Display was initially where our GUI code had lived. We turned Display.py into our main file so
it includes the full game. I.e. This file serves as the glue between the GUI and the Server in which 
player movement and position and tracked by the server and then sent to both clients GUI to update the 
display

Sprites.py: Here we have all our Sprite Functionallity. We generate our Tanks as well as giving 
them a starting position, the obstacles on the map, and missiles the tanks shoot as well how they operate
during collisions with obstacles vs collisions with Tanks.
