* Arena.py:
 - same for Tanks
 - change Arena constructor to take length of Arena, not just size of Tank
 
* tankMoveTest.py
 - move sep pieces into funcs
 - integrate w/Arena driver
 - add objects
    * make them impassable

* Create Tank.py: similar to Tile.py
 - also has direction that it's facing
 - health points, power, etc

* Create main (client) driver/skeleton main with:
 - takes IP address of server as argument
 - attempt to connect to server, display message of 'failed', 'waiting for other
 user', or 'starting game'. 
 - receives Message object from server, checks contents, sends update info to
 Display
 - also receives coordinates for movement or for attack from Display, pickles
 the data, and sends to server
 - tells display when to show win/lose messages

 * GUI
 - Game Over pop up for player
    - You Win pop-up for other player
 - interactions between obstacles and tanks (mostly handled server-side)
 - keypresses --> data sent to client, in order to update server
    - then use updated data from server to update display
 - need missiles, explosion (maybe)
